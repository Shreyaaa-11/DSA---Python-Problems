## 🧠 Daily Coding Practice

Welcome to my personal repository where I solve **daily coding problems** to stay sharp, consistent, and always learning. This space is my digital journal of progress, discipline, and problem-solving growth.

## 📌 Why This Repo?

I strongly believe that **consistency beats intensity**. Whether it's a simple string reversal or a dynamic programming puzzle, I treat every problem as an opportunity to grow. This repo:

- Keeps me **accountable**
- Tracks my **learning journey**
- Helps improve my **problem-solving skills**

## 🐍 I Code in Python

I love writing clean, efficient, and readable code in **Python**.
